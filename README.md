 *second-upload; I have been working on          
 - dimensions and layout.
 - Set up basic @media breaks.

 *3- upload; working on the JavaScript fetch/employee card functions/ Modal function/ event listeners.
 - working out the overlay with functioning left and right scroll arrows
 
 *4-upload
 - working out bugs in the left and right scroll query. finally have all the parameters in place now for functioning arrows.
 -finally have the overlay in the place I want it and background is in place.

*5-upload
 - had to finish the employee search bar. altho I already submitted a finished version without the search. it really bothered me that I didn't do it. so I stepped up to the challenge

 *6-upload
 - well first submission didn't pass, as the styling didn't match up with the mock-ups. this gives me a chance to finish up on the search bar. this has been a challenge as it still looks up city as well as name of employee. something to keep me puzzling away, but hopefully at this point. my updated file will pass as it is now. fingers crossed.
